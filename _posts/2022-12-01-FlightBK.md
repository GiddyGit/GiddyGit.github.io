title: Introducing Flight BK
---

Flight BK was a personal UI/UX design project, where I tried to figure out how to create a user friendly and intuitive app that helps working adults and 
students alike with finding cheap flights back home. 
My role within this project was to conduct user interviews, create wireframes, create a prototype, and finally conduct a usability testing for the prototype of the app. 

### Painpoints

For this project, I decided to extend my research to cover one aspect which I struggle with, which was booking a flight. As someone with a low income, often times I did not have the sufficient funds nor the capability to plan sophisticated holidays in advance. I always struggled with finding an app or a website that can direct me to the cheapest options available for me. The only possible way was to specify the direction, which can be a struggle when the airport of your choice is offering hundreds of flights. I wanted to research flights based on: 

* Location of the airport that the user will depart from
* Budget

This would allow users to plan a spontaneous trip. 

### User Research

In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:

* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes), available via `<body>` classes

### Browser support

Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
