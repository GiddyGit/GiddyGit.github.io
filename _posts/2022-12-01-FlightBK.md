title: Introducing Flight BK
---

<div class="message">Flight BK was a personal UI/UX design project, where I tried to figure out how to create a user friendly and intuitive app that helps working adults and 
students alike with finding cheap flights back home. 
My role within this project was to conduct user interviews, create wireframes, and finally create a prototype of the app.</div>

## Painpoints

For this project, I decided to extend my research to cover one aspect which I struggled with, which was booking a flight. As someone with a low income, often times I did not have the sufficient funds nor the capability to plan sophisticated holidays in advance. I always struggled with finding an app or a website that can direct me to the cheapest options available for me. The only possible way was to specify the direction, which can be a struggle when the airport of your choice is offering hundreds of flights. I wanted to research flights based on: 

* Location of the airport that the user will depart from
* Budget

This would allow users to plan a spontaneous trip. 

## User Research

For the user research, I conducted an in-person interview with 3 young professionals, each interview lasting for 20 minutes each, to define what the user goals and user problems are. I came up with a couple questions to ask beforehand:

* What apps do you normally use to book a flight?
* What do you take into consideration when choosing a destination?
* How do you plan your holidays?
* What do you struggle with the most when booking for a flight?
* What did you find challenging or frustrating that made it harder for you to use a flight?
* Do you prefer using apps or websites when booking a flight?
* Do you print your flight schedules?
* How would you like your flight details to be saved in digital form?
* What is your purpose for booking flights?

To summarize the responses, the **user goals** were defined as follows:

* Seeing prices clearly
* Getting cheap flights
* Finding a flight based on budget, and not the destination
* Being able to add more details to the itinerary 
* Travel tips
* Adding flights to a smartphone payment system
* More detailed suggestions upon arrival
* Outline of the destination
* Accessible refund policies 
* Newsletters based on user preferences

The **painpoints** (aka **user problems**) were defined as follows:

* Confusing pricing
* Too many destinations to look from
* Not being able to have access to the itinerary when needed
* Wasn't able to find good deals 
* Having to waste time at the airport
* Having to keep track of the trip on different apps

## Initial Sketches and Site Mapping

In the early ideation, I made sure to design based on these **4** principles:

1. **Usable** (Is everything in the design easy to find?)
2. **Equitable** (Are the needs of every user considered?)
3. **Enjoyable** (Are there any aspects of the design that considers the users' feelings?)
4. **Useful** (Does the design add value to the users' experience?)

I began by sketching some rough ideas of how the app should look like, by identifying the amount of content on each screen:

![sketch4](/assets/20220902_152531.jpg "Itinerary page"){:height="400px" width="600px"}

## Wireframes

After creating the sketches, I then went on to create high-fidelity wireframes for each of the screens:

## Thought Process

Here I would like to explain my thought process for each screen and how I wanted for them to function, taking the user goals and user problems I have gathered into consideration. 

### First screen

For the screen at the top left, users can skip the registration or sign in process and use the app first, until they get to the payment section where they use the info inputted to make account, so that there will be a higher rate of users who will continue to use the app and complete their purchases. 

### Sign-in and sign up screens

For the sign-in screen and sign up screen below the top left screen, firstly the email input shows up and depending on the email it can detect whether a user already made an account or not and it would either show a password and sign in button (plus sign in with verification link), or a sign up page asking to make a password and confirming the password, thus creating an account.

### Tab bar and search screen

For the tab bar attached below to the screens, I wanted it to contain an explore page (which includes newsletters and trip tips, suggested flights, cost of living, discounts, currency comparisons), a search page (which includes budgets, departure dates, and return dates), bookings (which contains itinerary details and detailed suggestions upon arrival), and profile page (which includes refund policies, payments, and general settings).

When choosing the location, users can select multiple destination points, and users can input text instead of having to scroll through a long list of countries to save time. 
For the calendar/date picker, I also wanted to make sure text input was possible to make it convenient for users.Users also don't have to enter certain information to begin their searches, which means they can leave some categories empty.

I chose tabs as they are easier to touch for right handed users since it is at the bottom of the page and not at the top so users don't have to stretch their thumb all the way to the top of the screen. 

### Search results screen

The search results screen gives options to show flights that are the cheapest to the most expensive. 

When users pull down the screen and let it go, it will update the results.

Users can filter their searches by morning, afternoon, and night for when to board their flights(outbound/return) and for departures (outbound/return). Users can also filter by 1 or 2+ stops, and filter by airlines.

The total cost is put at the very top, next to the dollar sign logo in bold letters, and the button is labeled "select". After users select it, more details on the itinerary shows up, then you can finally make your purchase. 

Underneath the price, users can see the time and location abbreviated underneath it. 

### Passenger info screen

Since there is a requirement for airlines to know users' passport info, the passenger info screen asks for users' full name (first name and last name), date of birth, specified gender, and contact number. 
At the top it tells users to input their information exactly at it is written on their passport. 

### Select seats screen

When users reach the seat selection screen, it shows the locations in abbreviated letters, to and fro, at the top so it is easy to see. The labels indicate the seats and if they are available or not (available, unavailable, selected). Inside the placeholder image, there are little blocks in them that are the seats, and in order to see other seats, users can tap the down button. 
 
This screen also includes info such as date, time, airline name, stops, and how many hours the flight is. 

### Checkout screen

The checkout screen displays the logos for payment types: credit/debit, paypal, and apple pay. 
I also left the option for users to cancel their payment below the payment confirmation button. When users cancel their payments, it takes them back to the explore page. Checkout screens also save payment details, and autofills informations to make transactions quicker.

### Payment confirmed screen

For the final screen, it displays "payment complete" with a big check mark, which then moves to the top, in a smaller font, and displays flight tickets which users can download/print or show at the airport check in. 
The button at the bottom is labeled "download" which lets users download the ticket then print it themselves. 
Users can also slide to the right or left to see other tickets they have purchased.

## Prototype

After creating the wireframes, I created the protoypes of the wireframes in figma, with the intention of making the the UI softer, rounded and more playful looking, making some changes to the initial wireframe designs along the way. I made the UI softer and more playful looking by using fonts such as Roboto and Nunito, and included colors such as blue which is a safe and familiar color for almost everyone.

I decided that adding labels to the tab icons is necessary, since not everyone may be able to understand the icons and what they mean. I also included labels for the filtering icon, as it is not widely recognized.

On top of these changes, I added an international telephone input in the passenger info screen, and set a sensible default for the country. For the functionality, I wanted the app to prefill country codes based on the user's geolocation data.
I also wanted to allow users to modify the country code when necessary. I desgined the country code selector to look like an interactive element â€” the users should know that they can change it.

For the date of birth input, a research which tested a number of iterations with a range of actual live users concluded that just having three separate number fields, with text labels assigned was the most usable pattern for humans.
