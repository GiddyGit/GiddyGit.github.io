title: Introducing Flight BK
---

<div class="message">Flight BK was a personal UI/UX design project, where I tried to figure out how to create a user friendly and intuitive app that helps working adults and 
students alike with finding cheap flights back home. 
My role within this project was to conduct user interviews, create wireframes, create a prototype, and finally conduct a usability testing for the prototype of the app.</div>

### Painpoints

For this project, I decided to extend my research to cover one aspect which I struggled with, which was booking a flight. As someone with a low income, often times I did not have the sufficient funds nor the capability to plan sophisticated holidays in advance. I always struggled with finding an app or a website that can direct me to the cheapest options available for me. The only possible way was to specify the direction, which can be a struggle when the airport of your choice is offering hundreds of flights. I wanted to research flights based on: 

* Location of the airport that the user will depart from
* Budget

This would allow users to plan a spontaneous trip. 

### User Research

For the user research, I conducted an in-person interview with 3 young professionals, each interview lasting for 20 minutes each, to define what the user goals and user problems are. I came up with a couple questions to ask beforehand:

* What apps do you normally use to book a flight?
* What do you take into consideration when choosing a destination?
* How do you plan your holidays?
* What do you struggle with the most when booking for a flight?
* What did you find challenging or frustrating that made it harder for you to use a flight?
* Do you prefer using apps or websites when booking a flight?
* Do you print your flight schedules?
* How would you like your flight details to be saved in digital form?
* What is your purpose for booking flights?

To summarize the responses, the **user goals** were defined as follows:

* Seeing prices clearly
* Getting cheap flights
* Finding a flight based on budget, and not the destination
* Being able to add more details to the itinerary 
* Travel tips
* Adding flights to a smartphone payment system
* More detailed suggestions upon arrival
* Outline of the destination
* Accessible refund policies 
* Newsletters based on user preferences

The **painpoints** (aka **user problems**) were defined as follows:

* Confusing pricing
* Too many destinations to look from
* Not being able to have access to the itinerary when needed
* Wasn't able to find good deals 
* Having to waste time at the airport
* Having to keep track of the trip on different apps

### Initial Sketches and Site Mapping

In the early ideation, I made sure to design based on these **4** principles:

1. **Usable** (Is everything in the design easy to find?)
2. **Equitable** (Are the needs of every user considered?)
3. **Enjoyable** (Are there any aspects of the design that considers the users' feelings?)
4. **Useful** (Does the design add value to the users' experience?)

I began by sketching some rough ideas of how the app should look like, by identifying the amount of content on each screen:
